- Welcome to my Traceroute Packet Analyzer

## A little about me
Name: Brendon Earl  
Student #: V00797149  

## And why I wrote this code
Course: CSC 361 (Communication Networks)  
Assignment: #3 - Analysis of IP Protocol  

## How to use this thing
Ensure you have __python3.6__ installed.  
As this application does have dependencies, 
ensure you install `pcapy` version `0.11` or higher. 
Depending on you environment you can do this using `pip3`, `pypi` or other package managers.  
If your setup uses `pip3` run `pip3 install pcapy`, and you should be good to go.  
Then, depending on your configutation run either:  

`python analyze_traceroute <pcap_file_location>` or  
`python3 analyze_traceroute <pcap_file_location>`

where `<pcap_file_location>` is a path like `./pcaps/my_example_pcap_file.pcap` or `my_example_pcap_file.pcap`

## Expected behaviour
This application will parse a pcap file, and do it's best to interpret and analyse 
traceroute ttl traces. It should create an output according to the assignment spec, noted 
below in the output section.

## Output

```
TBD

__Happy Marking!__

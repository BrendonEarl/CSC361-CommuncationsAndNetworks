# Welcome to my SmartWebClient

## A little about me
Name: Brendon Earl  
Student #: V00797149  

## And why I wrote this code
Course: CSC 361 (Communication Networks)  
Assignment: #1 - Smart HTTP Web Client  

## How to use this thing
Ensure you have __python3.6__ installed  
Then, depending on your configutation run either:  

`python SmartWebClient <www.domain.tld>` or  
`python3 SmartWebClient <www.domain.tld>`

where `<www.domain.tld>` is a web address like `www.github.com` or `docs.python.org`

## Expected behaviour
If the web-server is misbehaving (not my fault), I'll do my best to let you know!
Sometimes a supported `newest HTTP-Version` will be noted as `None`,
that's be cause they dropped the connection and never got back.
